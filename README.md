# BiblicalCoin
The Tokenomics were designed to benefit humanity and investors. We are a Christian Ministry and have been for years. With no physical location, what better than to have a cryptocurrency powering the ministry team who are spread out over the world? You will find that we are much different than most Christian ministries as well. We do not divide but rather unite all denominations. We are all brothers and sisters in Christ. 

You can also rest assured that your money will be going to spreading the gospel and helping those in need. Feel free to check out my main YT channel where we have been doing just that for the past four years = https://shorturl.at/epqU5
We may use funds from the team wallet twice a year for outreach and charity. During this time we will make sure the liquidity in Uniswap is high so the token price does not fluctuate wildly. Then we will use funds to get our ministry's content supplied to churches worldwide and help those in need by selecting charities and individuals.  God wants us to use our wealth to provide for our fellow believers and our families (1 Timothy 5:8). Finally, a small percentage that is left will go into marketing and those who hold BC and are helping promote will be rewarded with Free BC tokens via Airdrop. 
 

Integration

We are thrilled to announce a groundbreaking collaboration between Biblical Coin and Standing for Truth Ministries, aimed at amplifying the profound message of the gospel. As pioneers at the vanguard of the digital finance revolution, we are poised to revolutionize the way we perceive and engage with monetary transactions. Our mission transcends traditional banking boundaries, as we aspire to empower both the banked and unbanked communities, fostering an inclusive environment for those who share our vision.

In line with our commitment to accessibility, we have developed a unique token that resonates with like-minded individuals. This token serves as a conduit for individuals who seek to align their financial endeavors with their spiritual values. By leveraging this innovative platform, we aim to bridge the gap between faith and finance, enabling individuals to seamlessly merge their monetary pursuits with their spiritual journey.

Furthermore, recognizing the socioeconomic challenges faced by many, we have taken deliberate steps to ensure inclusivity extends beyond investment opportunities. To this end, we have crafted an engaging "play-to-earn" game, granting individuals from all walks of life an equal chance to participate in a monthly tournament. This exciting competition offers the prospect of winning free Biblical Coin to the top three achievers, even enabling those who may lack the means to invest to partake in the rewards. With this multifaceted approach, we are not only revolutionizing the digital finance landscape but also fostering a sense of community, where individuals can unite in their pursuit of financial and spiritual growth. Join us on this remarkable journey, as we propel the message of the gospel to new horizons through the integration of Biblical Coin and Standing for Truth Ministries.
